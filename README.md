# Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodori", from the Italian word pomodoro for "tomato". The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.

There are five basic steps to implementing the technique:

    1. Decide on the task to be done
    2. Set the pomodoro timer to n minutes (traditionally 25)
    3. Work on the task until the timer rings; record with an x
    4. Take a short break (3-5 minutes)
    5. Every four "pomodori" take a longer break (15â€“30 minutes)
